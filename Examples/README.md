## Estimote SDK example apps

**Hint:**
You can generate yourself a ready-made project from most of these templates on https://cloud.estimote.com/#/apps/add. It will be automatically renamed for you, and have your App Token and beacon UUIDs already put in.

- **Blank**

A blank Xcode project with Estimote SDK already integrated.

- **Notification**

> Uses: beacon monitoring, local notifications

Show a notification if the app is not running, and the user enters or exits range of a monitored beacon.

- **ProximityContent**

> Uses: ranging beacons, Estimote Cloud API to fetch the beacon's name & color

Change the background color and text on the screen depending on which of the ranged beacons is the closest.

- **Showroom**

> Uses: [sticker beacons](http://estimote.com/#products), Nearable packet, trigger engine

Change the text on screen when user picks up a nearable (motion detection). Imagine, e.g., an iPad mounted in a showroom, and products with Estimote Stickers attached to them. Whenever a visitor picks an item up, the iPad shows information about the product.

- **Configuration** (Swift only, requires Estimote Beacons with the 4th-gen firmware, 4.x+)

> Uses: SDK 4.0's configuration API, Estimote Cloud: tags & geolocation

Configure and tag your beacons for deployment. _(See the README.md file in this project's directory for more info.)_

- **GPIO** (Swift only, requires Estimote Beacons with the 4th-gen firmware, 4.x+)

> Uses: SDK 4.0's configuration API â€¦ and, well, GPIO (:

Wirelessly access external devices connected to the beacons' GPIO ports. _(See the README.md file in this project's directory for more info.)_

- **Loyalty** (Swift only, requires Estimote Beacons with the 4th-gen firmware, 4.x+)

> Uses: Proximity beacons, beacon monitoring

Cashier-customer app that allows cashiers to see customers at checkout in their iPad app and grant them their bonus points for their shopping. Completely new way of earning points without carrying loyalty cards or scanning barcodes.

_(See the README.md file in this project's directory for more info.)_
